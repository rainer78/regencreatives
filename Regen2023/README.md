## About this Template
We believe it's very valuable for almost every Alexa skill or Google Action to have a landing page or website.
This is a place where you can direct your users to for additional information like FAQs, and to drive sign ups for your voice apps.

We know you'd probably rather improve your skill than doing frontend stuff. So we designed a simple template for you to get started with your landing page.

Please let us know if you have any questions and feedback! 
You can always reach us at team@jovo.tech.
